This repository is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository.

In the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, it mainly covers the analysis of gravitational wave data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Open Science Center (LOSC). The tutorial provides an introduction to gravitational waves and explains how to access and analyze the data using Python.
